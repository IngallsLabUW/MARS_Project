## MARS

### Metabolite Annotation, Rank and Sort

The MARS project is a way to easily identify unknown mass features (MFs)
in your data. It consists of three major sections:

- A central database containing unknown mass features (MFs) with mz, rt
  and ms2 data detected by the Ingalls lab
- A series of processes and functions for annotating, ranking, and
  scoring those MFs
- A central database containing annotated MFs from previous MARS
  missions

Flexible, updatable, searchable, rankable, exportable.
