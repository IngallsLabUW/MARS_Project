### MARS Project Log

- In the getMetlinName function, it looks like the output of exact_mass is already accounting for the proton weight. So only need it for MoNA?
- Still need to get msms for metlin up and running, but not crucial.

- Fragment matching: % of library sample found in fragments. 
    Example, experimental spectra has *110.97466, 100;* 110.03485, 39.1; *58.02862, 33.5;* 68.01299, 26.6; 111.01888, 20.6.
    Library spectra has               *110.97466, 100;* 109.00000, 40.1; *58.02862, 33.5;* 70.33989, 26.6; 121.04950, 15.0.
    If the above two lines were identical, the fragment match would be 100%. In this situation, the fragment match would be 40% or 0.4.


What about potential matches that are non/z non/column matched?

This is an ongoing log: a place for build notes and questions.
*This is not to be confused with the Design Doc on the Shared Google Drive; that is for overall design direction and team suggestions. It is also not a README, which will be written closer to project completion.*

What is being worked on right now

*Confidence Level 1*

- Use [FuzzyJoin](http://varianceexplained.org/fuzzyjoin/) to match m/z, rt, column, and z for positive IDs and return a dataframe of matches. 

*Similarity Score*

- For the overall spectral similarity score, a combination of several equations from KRH and Tsugawa et. al form a total similarity equation for scoring.

*Confidence Level 2*

- Match unknown experimental values to MoNA and Metlin dataframes (which will be updated either every quarter, or as often as necessary). 

*Confidence Level 3*
KEGG


#### Notes

- Need to replace old compound names with new ones!
- For DDA high resolution, the mass spec sees a high signal. When it see that, it takes above and below that signal and isolates it in the collision chamber. In the ms2 df, the first column is the exact mass with an intensity of 100 (maximum), then second mass and intensity, etc.
