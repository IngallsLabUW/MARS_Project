### TBD Compound Project Log

This is an ongoing log: a place for build notes and questions.
*This is not to be confused with the Design Doc on the Shared Google Drive; that is for overall design direction and team suggestions. It is also not a README, which will be designed closer to project completion.*

Initial TODO: 
Start with the workflow of the mz/rt/ms2/z/column dataframe --> annotated dataframe, using only the standards on some user data.

#### Issues
I have output from Will, Josh, and Katherine (and eventually Angie). The output is from a variety of sources (xcms, MSDIAL), and is presented in a variety of formats. 

1. Input needs to be standardized first. Standardization should take place through script/functions, similar to the Targeted Pipeline. Eventually that script/function process will be part of the R package. 
2. What stages are the various dataframes in? Some look like they have been annotated already with matches of varying confidence.
