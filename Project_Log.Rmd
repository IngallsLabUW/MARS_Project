### MARS Project Log

This is an ongoing log: a place for build notes and questions.
*This is not to be confused with the Design Doc on the Shared Google Drive; that is for overall design direction and team suggestions. It is also not a README, which will be written closer to project completion.*

#### TODO: 
What is being worked on right now

- Match experimental unknowns with MoNA dataframes. 
- Transform MS2 from MSP --> standards list in the KRH spectral format.
  + This step will require cleaning, including but not limited to no intensities below 1 (throw out all those tiny fragment spectra), scale intensity so the biggest value is 100, and then order by descending intensity. intensity needs to be descending and scaled so the biggest value is 100.

New standards MS2: It's actually 12 total injections for pos and 12 for neg since we have two different standard mixes.

#### Specific Questions

- 

---

*Confidence Level 1*

- Use [FuzzyJoin](http://varianceexplained.org/fuzzyjoin/) to match m/z, rt, column, and z for positive IDs and return a dataframe of matches. 

*Similarity Score*

- For the overall spectral similarity score, a combination of several equations from KRH and Tsugawa et. al form a total similarity equation for scoring.

*Confidence Level 2*

- Match unknown experimental values to MoNA and Metlin dataframes (which will be updated either every quarter, or as often as necessary).

#### Specific Questions

- The massbankMS2MatchNEGATIVE (and I assume POSITIVE) function doesn't like when the experimental data comes without an MS2 column. For now I am just filtering those rows out, but would it be preferable to hang on to that data?
- Currently we are filtering out matches that have a cosine similarity < 0.8. Ok to totally throw those out or better to keep them as a lower-confidence match? Ditto on the MassBankppm < 5 filter. I can also change both of these to variables.
- There is a step in the Candidates df production that combines the "MF_Frac" column with the narrowed-down candidates from MoNA. In the original code this inserts a character vector of the whole original MF_Frac column into the dataframe cell. Better to match back to the relevant MF_Frac identification?


#### Ongoing issues
Issues that will need to be fixed eventually

- Tidy up the workflow of the mz/rt/ms2/z/column dataframe to a Confidence Level 1 annotated dataframe.
- Set up flexible equation for Total.Similarity score.
- The dataframes to be annotated are from a variety of sources (xcms, MSDIAL), and are presented in a variety of formats and curation levels.
- Input will need to be standardized, through the annotation functions. Eventually that script/function process will be part of the R package. 
- "w/o MS2:" on identified compounds is from MSDIAL output and currently isn't matching that we should rely on.
- Need to replace old compound names with new ones! Will work on that later.
- Need to reliably translate msp files for incorporation. KRH has a json translation but not msp. 
- Also we stds list, but we don't know the collision energy. 
- Make a function to investigate which columns are only NULL.
- For now, using given tolerance values is fine, but eventually we should be calculating it from the fuzzyjoin tolerance *clarify this later with KRH*.
- For now, we can compare to our own spectra and use 0.02 as tolerance. Revisit later to make it into ppm space.


#### Other notes
- Remember, you can get the score w/out MS2! The eventual full function should be able to do both.
- Will can make an MS2 library for stds
- Naming schemes are all different for unique mass features
- Potential change for rt times to nano energy
- Spectra are relative abundances.
- For DDA high resolution, the mass spec sees a high signal. When it see that, it takes above and below that signal and isolates it in the collision chamber. In the ms2 df, the first column is the exact mass with an intensity of 100 (maximum), then second mass and intensity, etc.
