### MARS Project Log

- Fragment matching: % of library sample found in fragments. 
    Example, experimental spectra has *110.97466, 100;* 110.03485, 39.1; *58.02862, 33.5;* 68.01299, 26.6; 111.01888, 20.6.
    Library spectra has               *110.97466, 100;* 109.00000, 40.1; *58.02862, 33.5;* 70.33989, 26.6; 121.04950, 15.0.
    If the above two lines were identical, the fragment match would be 100%. In this situation, the fragment match would be 40% or 0.4.
- The "replacing" of the theoretical values to cut down on columns should be a hidden function.
- For retention time, use the standar runs that are in the same batches to calibrate retention time. This would be BEFORE entering 
MARS. MARS will not facilitate this step most likely.

Potential layout for in-house database:
Name TBD, just samples? Post-QC?

example: 171009_Smp_DSW700m_1

**ID.col      | mz     | column | z  | rt | ms2 if possible | other.metadata | Full concatenated name**
MESOSCOPE2017 | 88.987 | HILIC  | -1 | Cruise name, replicate,

This is an ongoing log: a place for build notes and questions.
*This is not to be confused with the Design Doc on the Shared Google Drive; that is for overall design direction and team suggestions. It is also not a README, which will be written closer to project completion.*

#### Notes

- Need to replace old compound names with new ones!
- For DDA high resolution, the mass spec sees a high signal. When it see that, it takes above and below that signal and isolates it in the collision chamber. In the ms2 df, the first column is the exact mass with an intensity of 100 (maximum), then second mass and intensity, etc.
