### MARS Project Log

This is an ongoing log: a place for build notes and questions.
*This is not to be confused with the Design Doc on the Shared Google Drive; that is for overall design direction and team suggestions. It is also not a README, which will be designed closer to project completion.*

Initial TODO: 
Start with the workflow of the mz/rt/ms2/z/column dataframe --> annotated dataframe, using only the standards on some user data.

#### Issues
I have output from Will, Josh, and Katherine (and eventually Angie). The output is from a variety of sources (xcms, MSDIAL), and is presented in a variety of formats and curation points.

1. Input needs to be standardized first. Standardization should take place through script/functions, similar to the Targeted Pipeline. Eventually that script/function process will be part of the R package. 
2. What stages are the various dataframes in? Some look like they have been annotated already with matches of varying confidence.
3. "w/o MS2:" is from MSDIAL output and currently isn't great matching.
4. Need to replace compound names with new ones! Will work on that later.
4. Need to translate msp for incorporation, KRH has a json translation but not msp (shouldn't be too hard for R ingestion.) Also stds list, but we don't know the collision energy. 

*Confidence Level 1*
- What tolerance level works for m.z matching? 
- Some compounds have the same RT (or extremely similar). Use that as a second metric?

*Similarity Score*
- Make a function to investigate which columns are only NULL. 
- The items in "columns.to.drop" need a second look.
