### MARS Project Log

This is an ongoing log: a place for build notes and questions.
*This is not to be confused with the Design Doc on the Shared Google Drive; that is for overall design direction and team suggestions. It is also not a README, which will be written closer to project completion.*

#### TODO: 
What is being worked on right now

- Tidy up the workflow of the mz/rt/ms2/z/column dataframe to a Confidence Level 1 annotated dataframe.
- Confirm equation for full similarity scoring.

---

#### Specific Questions

- In the original MSMScosine_1 function, the tolerance level for m.z matching is set as 0.02. Is this a good rule of thumb level?
KRH - It depends on the quality of the spectra that we're comparing to.  If we are comparing to our own spectra, 0.02 is probably good, but it's better to do everything in ppm space.  I say just use that mz tolerance as a default but it should be a variable and we can revisit later to make it into ppm space.

- The MSMScosine_1 function doesn't actually call the mass1 and mass2 inputs (see code section below). Are those just a typo?
KRH - The way that I implement the cosine function is that I only do the comparision after mass1 and mass2.  See function massbankMS2MatchPOSITIVE for an example.  To calculate the cosine, you don't actually need the parente masses.  There is another similarity metric (MSMScosine_2, its a neutral loss metric), where you need parent masses.  I'd look at MSMScosine_1_df to see how you can feed in a df of mass1, mass2, scan1 (in my format), scan2 and get an output of df$cosine.  I'd start there before going too deep into the 

- Are the scan1 and scan2 variables I am using correct? I am inputting two mini dataframes, one of the MS2 data from the MFCluster_Assignments sheet, and the other from the standards MS2 sheet. Each mini dataframe is two columns, the first "mz" and the second "intensity". I'm getting errors that I can fix but maybe it's from incorrect input.
KRH - scan1 and scan2 are outputs of the scantable() function in XCMSfuns.R, you give it a string in my format of spectra, and it gives you a df (maybe a matrix, I can't remember).  I think we need to work on getting our MS2 from MSP into the standards list into the same spectra format as in my sheet before its useful to test it. 

- Checking that the standard deviation denominator in Equation 3 the standard deviation of the difference between the experimental and theoretical values?
KRH - those are supposed to be standard deviation of the experimental and/or theoretical value, essentially a measure of the precision associated with each of those values. They are dependent of but smaller than the mz tolerance and rt tolerance, so a good way to build that in might be to have that denominator = 0.5 x mz_tol or rt_tol.

---

*Confidence Level 1*

- Use [FuzzyJoin](http://varianceexplained.org/fuzzyjoin/) to match m/z, rt, column, and z for positive IDs and return a dataframe of matches. 

*Similarity Score*

- For the overall spectral similarity score, a combination of several equations from KRH and Tsugawa et. al form a total similarity equation for scoring.

![Tusgawa et al, 2015.](figures/TotalSimilarityScore.png)

The equation is flexible depending on which variables are available. Below are alternative equations. If retention time is not available for compound identification, the total score is calculated using **Equation 13**. If the formula information is not available, the use **Equation 14**. If neither retention time nor formular information are available, use **Equation 15**.

![Tusgawa et al, 2015.](figures/All_Equations.png)

Each variable of the Total Similarity Equation (TSE) is produced by a separate equation. Starting at the beginning with the MS/MS similarity, an equation in R is used from KRH to produce cosine similarity:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

MSMScosine_1 <- function(scan1, scan2) {
  # Finds the cosine similarity method for comparing two mass spectra.
  #
  # Args
  #   scan1 & scan2: Tiny dataframes of ms2, first column is mz, second column is intensity.
  #
  # Returns
  #   similarity: A similarity score between 0 and 1, indicating the similarity of the two vectors.
  #   
  #
  mztolerance <- 0.02
  
  w1 <- (scan1[, 1] ^ 2) * sqrt(scan1[, 2])
  w2 <- (scan2[, 1] ^ 2) * sqrt(scan2[, 2])
  
  diffmatrix <- sapply(scan1[, 1], function(x) scan2[, 1] - x) 
  sameindex <- which(abs(diffmatrix) < mztolerance, arr.ind = T)
  
  similarity <- sum(w1[sameindex[, 2]] * w2[sameindex[, 1]]) / (sqrt(sum(w2 ^ 2)) * sqrt(sum(w1 ^ 2)))
  
  return(similarity)
}

## Example of cosine similarity using only Uracil
Inosine.standard.msp <- read.delim("data_extra/Ingalls_HILICNeg_Standards.msp", header = FALSE, sep = "") %>%
  slice(56:66) %>%
  rename(mz = 1, intensity = 2) %>%
  mutate(mz = as.numeric(mz),
         intensity = as.numeric(intensity))

Uracil.KRH.msp.mine <- read.csv("data_from_lab_members/MFCluster_Assignments_Katherine.csv") %>%
  filter(Identification == "Uracil") %>%
  select(MS2) %>%
  separate_rows(MS2, sep = ";") %>%
  separate(MS2, into = c("mz", "intensity"), sep = ",") %>%
    mutate(mz = as.numeric(mz),
         intensity = as.numeric(intensity))

Uracil.Similarity.Score <- MSMScosine_1(scan1 = Uracil.standard.msp, scan2 = Uracil.KRH.msp)

```

Above is a hypothetical run of the function: not working right now because the diffmatrix variable returns as a list, and so results in a "Error in abs(diffmatrix) : non-numeric argument to mathematical function" issue. This will be fixed as soon as the overall setup is confirmed.


Next, the MS1 similarity (and retention time similarity) is obtained by using the below equation. The experimental value is the m/z acquired from the experimental results, while the theoretical value is the m/z from the established literature (in our case, the standards list). The standard deviation **comes from the difference between the experimental and theoretical values?**

#### Ongoing issues
Issues that will need to be fixed eventually

- The dataframes to be annotated are from a variety of sources (xcms, MSDIAL), and are presented in a variety of formats and curation levels.
- Input will need to be standardized, through the annotation functions. Eventually that script/function process will be part of the R package. 
- "w/o MS2:" on identified compounds is from MSDIAL output and currently isn't matching that we should rely on.
- Need to replace old compound names with new ones! Will work on that later.
- Need to reliably translate msp files for incorporation. KRH has a json translation but not msp. 
- Also we stds list, but we don't know the collision energy. 
- Make a function to investigate which columns are only NULL.

#### Notes from KRH MS1 Similarity and MSMS cosine similarity talk Nov 6

The delta in equation 3 (MS1 similarity) is the "intuition" from KRH and others about the many runs completed in the lab. In an ideal world, we would inject the Uracil standard thousands of time and then calculate that delta precision from those acquired values. Instead, we use the RT and m/z tolerance values that we currently use in our QC. 
For now, using those above values is fine, but eventually we should be calculating it from the fuzzyjoin tolerance *clarify this later with KRH*.
Regarding the MS2 cosine similarity, the dot product equation in the msdial paper (equation 6) is very nearly the same thing as the ms2 cosine similarity function from KRH. Eventually, we should dig into the ideal algorithem for that; there are lots available and we should tailor it to our needs. In particular, including the reverse dot product should be considered For now the total similarity score (ms2 similarity from KRH + MS1 similarity from msdial / 2, see equation 15) is fine. 

Lastly, the msp -> dataframe workflow needs to incorporate some cleaning, including but not limited to no intensities below 1 (throw out all those tiny fragment spectra), intensity needs to be descending and scaled so the biggest value is 100. Check the KRH functions for any others. 


#### Other notes
- Remember, you can get the score w/out MS2! The eventual full function should be able to do both.
- Will can make an MS2 library for stds
- Naming schemes area all different for unique mass features
- Potential change for rt times to nano energy
- Spectra are relative abundances.
- For DDA high resolution, the mass spec sees a high signal. When it see that, it takes above and below that signal and isolates it in the collision chamber. In the ms2 df, the first column is the exact mass with an intensity of 100 (maximum), then second mass and intensity, etc.
